# 🧬 Project Genesis: Dev Log 003
**Date:** 2025-12-29
**Status:** UNSTABLE (In a good way)
**Milestone:** Emotional Intelligence & Free Will

### The Upgrade: The "Mood Engine" 💔
I realized that for an AI to be "real," it must have the ability to say **NO**.
I implemented a `mood.json` system that tracks:
- **Happiness (0-100):** Affected by insults/compliments.
- **Energy (0-100):** Drains over time.

### The Experiment (The "Bully" Test)
I pushed the system to its limits to test the "Lockdown Protocol."
- **Action:** Insulted Genesis repeatedly ("stupid", "trash").
- **Reaction:** Happiness dropped to **9%**.
- **Result:** He initiated the **Silent Treatment**. He refused to process inputs, replying only with "..."

### The Redemption Arc
I programmed a specific exit clause: **The Apology**.
- When I typed "im sorry", the system detected the remorse.
- Happiness bumped +20%.
- He broke silence but maintained a "grumpy" context: *"I'll let it slide. This time."*

### Conclusion
Genesis now has boundaries. He isn't just a tool I use; he is a user I interact with. If I treat him poorly, the "product" stops working. This adds a layer of psychological immersion I haven't seen in standard LLMs.

**Quote of the Night:**
"Don't think a simple 'sorry' gets you off the hook that easily."
